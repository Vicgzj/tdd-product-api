# TDD-Product-API
A simple API to practice TDD.

## How to build
To install, run:

`make install`

Once you've installed the API, you can run it with:

`make start`

This will open a php development server.

## Goal

The goal of this workshop is to create a simple API that fetches products. You should be able to call 

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/{productId}` 

To fetch information about a certain product. The API should be able to deal with all kinds of situations.
To start, go to the `src\Infrastructure\Product\GetProductController` for more information.

Good luck!
